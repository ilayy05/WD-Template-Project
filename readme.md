## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->

The project focuses on creating a website for a specific product, the product that was assigned to me was a Bar. 
The website was made in Visual Code using HTML with the help of External stylesheet tools such as CSS and preset code websites
such as Bootstrap to give coders or in our case artists an easier way to code and design a website. 

### Key Components

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
WD-ProjectName
└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
